## Introduction

This guide is written in order to assist members of the team at AnalogFolk 
London to write good quality front end applications. This is intended as a brief checklist and set of baseline standards for work to follow.

### General Principles

- Don't prematurely optimise; keep it readable, well commented and understandable
- All code in any project should look like one person typed it
- Enforce the agreed upon styles through code review and pull request
- Never mix spaces and tabs for indentation.
- An EditorConfig should be added to any project to maintain conventions
