## Introduction

This guide is written in order to assist members of the team at AnalogFolk 
London in writing good quality front end applications. This is intended as a brief checklist and set of baseline standards for the team to follow. It should be shared with development partners as the set of standards for them to follow with all work on behalf of Analogfolk, and standards should be monitored and enforced by Technical Leads.

### General Principles

- Don't prematurely optimise; keep it readable, well commented and understandable
- All code in any project should look like one person typed it
- Enforce the agreed upon styles through code review and pull request
- Never mix spaces and tabs for indentation.
- An EditorConfig should be added to any project to maintain conventions
