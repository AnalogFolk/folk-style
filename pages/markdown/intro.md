## Introduction {.title .is-2}

This guide should be used to assist members of the team at Analogfolk 
London in writing good quality applications. This is intended as a 
brief checklist and set of baseline standards for the team to follow. It 
should be shared with development partners as the set of standards to 
follow in all work on behalf of Analogfolk. Adherence to standards should be 
monitored and enforced by Technical Leads.

### General Principles {.title .is-3}

- Don't prematurely optimise; keep it readable, well commented and understandable
- All code in any project should look like one person typed it
- Enforce the agreed upon styles through code review and pull request
- Never mix spaces and tabs for indentation.
- An [EditorConfig][editorconfig] should be added to any project to maintain conventions
