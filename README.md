# Folk Style

An opinionated but simple style guide for technical projects authored at
Analogfolk London.

## Build Setup

Local setup is simple enough; install dependencies and run the Nuxt project. The master branch is automatically deployed to Netlify.

It's a single page component. Individual guidelines are Markdown files included into the main page.

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## TODO

- Improve .NET section
- Add section on Infrastructure as code
- Add API Design principles (REST, versioning etc.)
- Add Typescript section
